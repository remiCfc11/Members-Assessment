## Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

### Example 1:

Input: `prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]`
Output: `5`

**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (`price = 1`) and sell on day 5 (`price = 6`), `profit = 6-1 = 5`.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

### Example 2:

Input: `prices = [7,6,4,3,1]`
Output: `0`

**Explanation:** In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
 

### Constraints:

- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`
