## 3Sum

Given an integer array `nums`, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that `i != j`, `i != k`, and `j != k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

### Example 1:
Input: `nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]`
Output: `[[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]`
**Explanation:** 
nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.

### Example 2:
Input: `nums = [0,1,1]`
Output: `[]`
**Explanation:** The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.

### Example 3:
Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`
Output: `[[0,0,0]]`
**Explanation:** The only possible triplet sums up to 0.

### Constraints:
- `3 <= nums.length <= 3000`
- `-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
