## Trapping Rain Water

Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

### Example 1:
![Trapping Rain Water](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/rainwatertrap.png)

Input: `height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]`
Output: `6`
**Explanation:** The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

### Example 2:
Input: `height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]`
Output: `9`

### Constraints:
- `n == height.length`
- `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 10^5`
