## Binary Search

Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 

### Example 1:

Input: `nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12]`, `target = 9`
Output: `4`

**Explanation:** `9` exists in `nums` and its index is `4`

### Example 2:

Input: `nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12]`, `target = 2`
Output: `-1`

**Explanation:** `2` does not exist in `nums` so return `-1`
 

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^4 < nums[i], target < 10^4`
- All the integers in `nums` are unique.
- `nums` is sorted in ascending order.
