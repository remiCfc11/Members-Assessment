## Roman to Integer

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

| Symbol | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| I | 1 |
| V | 5 |
| X | 10 |
| L | 50 |
| C | 100 |
| D | 500 |
| M | 1000 |

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make `4` and `9`. 
- `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make `40` and `90`. 
- `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make `400` and `900`.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

 

### Example 1:

Input: `s = "III"`
Output: `3`
Explanation: `III = 3`.

### Example 2:

Input: `s = "LVIII"`
Output: `58`
Explanation: `L = 50`, `V= 5`, `III = 3`.

### Example 3:

Input: `s = "MCMXCIV"`
Output: `1994`
Explanation: `M = 1000`, `CM = 900`, `XC = 90` and `IV = 4`.
 

### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 15`
- `s` contains only the characters (`'I'`, `'V'`, `'X'`, `'L'`, `'C'`, `'D'`, `'M'`).
- It is guaranteed that `s` is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].
