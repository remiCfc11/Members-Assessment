## Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.


### Example 1:

Input: `s = "abcabcbb"`
Output: `3`

**Explanation:** The answer is `"abc"`, with the length of `3`. Note that `"bca"` and `"cab"` are also correct answers.
### Example 2:

Input: `s = "bbbbb"`
Output: `1`

**Explanation:** The answer is `"b"`, with the length of `1`.

### Example 3:

Input: `s = "pwwkew"`
Output: `3`

**Explanation:** The answer is `"wke"`, with the length of `3`. Notice that the answer must be a substring, `"pwke"` is a subsequence and not a substring.
 

### Constraints:

- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
