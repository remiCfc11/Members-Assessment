## Rotate Array

Given an integer array `nums`, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

### Example 1:
Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3`
Output: `[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]`
**Explanation:**
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

### Example 2:
Input: `nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2`
Output: `[3,99,-1,-100]`
**Explanation:** 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]

### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- `0 <= k <= 10^5`

**Follow up:**
- Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least three different ways to solve this problem.
- Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

## Instruction
The `solution.py` file in this directory contains a buggy solution to this problem. Your task is to find and fix the bug in the solution. Please do not rewrite the entire solution. Create a new file named `solution_fixed.py`, copy the existing code from `solution.py` into it, and then apply your fix there.
